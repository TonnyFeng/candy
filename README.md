Attention
=========
**Please note that we had to change the organization name of Candy from "amiadogroup" to "candy-chat".**

This fork is just for not breaking users who forked the already existing repository.

**Please update your .git/config to use "candy-chat" instead of "amiadogroup" as the "origin"!**

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask in the mailinglist (link below).
